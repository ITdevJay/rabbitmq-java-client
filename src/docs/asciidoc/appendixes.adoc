== Micrometer Observation

It is possible to use https://docs.micrometer.io/micrometer/reference/observation.html[Micrometer Observation] to instrument publishing and consuming in the Java client.
Micrometer Observation provides https://spring.io/blog/2022/10/12/observability-with-spring-boot-3[metrics, tracing, and log correlation with one single API].

The Java client provides an `ObservationCollector` abstraction and an implementation for Micrometer Observation.
The following snippet shows how to create and set up the Micrometer `ObservationCollector` implementation with an existing `ObservationRegistry`:

.Configuring Micrometer Observation
[source,java,indent=0]
--------
include::{test-examples}/Api.java[tag=micrometer-observation]
--------
<1> Configure Micrometer `ObservationCollector` with builder
<2> Set Micrometer `ObservationRegistry` on `ConnectionFactory`

The next sections document the conventions, spans, and metrics made available by the instrumentation.
They are automatically generated from the source code with the https://github.com/micrometer-metrics/micrometer-docs-generator[Micrometer documentation generator].
